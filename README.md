# üß† SYN-TITAN: Synthetic Tabular Intelligence using Transformers and Adversarial Networks

> **SYN-TITAN** is an innovative hybrid framework that combines **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate realistic, privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data. It uses LLM-driven feature understanding and logical constraints to guide GAN training for improved data fidelity, semantic integrity, and rare category representation.

## ‚ú® Overview

**SYN-TITAN** is a hybrid LLM-GAN framework for high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data generation. It integrates large language models (LLMs) for feature conditioning and logical constraint enforcement within CTGAN training pipelines.

This repository contains:

- Data preprocessing scripts
- LLM prompt templates and usage notebooks
- CTGAN baseline and SYN-TITAN enhanced pipelines
- Evaluation scripts for KS Test, JS Divergence, Correlation MAE, Logical Violations, Privacy Risk, and Rare Category Coverage
