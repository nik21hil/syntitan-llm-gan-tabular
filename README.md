# üß† SYN-TITAN: Synthetic Tabular Intelligence using Transformers and Adversarial Networks

> The **Auto Audience Generator** is a smart, LLM-powered tool designed to automatically generate targeted user audiences from natural language prompts using a structured **Knowledge Graph (KG)**, rule-based filtering, and semantic matching.


## üìù Overview

**SYN-TITAN** is a hybrid LLM-GAN framework for high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data generation. It integrates large language models (LLMs) for feature conditioning and logical constraint enforcement within CTGAN training pipelines.

This repository contains:

- Data preprocessing scripts
- LLM prompt templates and usage notebooks
- CTGAN baseline and SYN-TITAN enhanced pipelines
- Evaluation scripts for KS Test, JS Divergence, Correlation MAE, Logical Violations, Privacy Risk, and Rare Category Coverage
